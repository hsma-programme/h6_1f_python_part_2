You should be completing this when prompted by the trainer as Exercise 1 of the session.  You should read each task, and then try to write code to achieve what you are being asked in the code cell below each set of instructions.  Remember - check your code is working by running the code cell (CTRL + Enter whilst in the cell, or click the play button to the left of the cell)."
